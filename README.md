The Unwinnable Game: A Tic-Tac-Toe AI Experiment

I built a Tic Tac Toe game that you can never win.

Spending a Saturday afternoon coding with Dart and Flutter, I decided to create a different kind of opponent. This game features a "Manual AI" I designed with one quirky rule: keep the game going forever.

ðŸ§  A Different Kind of AI: I wrote the logic from scratch to make the AI always play the perfect move to force a draw. Itâ€™s not trying to beat you; itâ€™s your eternal partner in stalemate.

ðŸ“± Clean Flutter UI: A smooth and simple interface so you can focus on trying to outsmart an opponent that refuses to be outsmarted.

ðŸ’¡ More Than a Game: This was a personal challenge to create a perfect loop, making it a fun and fascinating experiment in AI design and logic.

It's a simple game that asks a fun question: what's the point of playing if no one can win?
